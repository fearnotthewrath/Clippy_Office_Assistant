# Clippy_Office_Assistant
/r/Excel Points and Reference Bot

A few things to remember.

This bot was created specifically for /r/Excel.  There may be some features and other things that we are still currently working on, or there maybe some issues with some of the code.

We have tried to keep up with the code as much as possible, but we are not responsible for any issues it causes in your sub.


The files are as follows:

superclippy.db  - This is the database file that all transactions are captured in.
reference.txt - this file is used for the Excel Functions that can be called apon by useing the syntax: Clippy: VLOOKUP.
                  It will then return the values or the string for VLOOKUP.
superclippy_updated.py - python script for all of clippys function.

If you have any questions.  I will answer what I can, and help where I can.  Please if you run into any issues or find any bit of the code that could be improved apon, please share it with us!

Thanks,

FNW
